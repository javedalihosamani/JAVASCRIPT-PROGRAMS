        <h3>What is Promise?</h3>
        <p>Promise is built in constructor of javascript. </p>
        <p> A Promise object represents an operation which has produced or will eventually produce a value. Promises provide a robust way to wrap the (possibly pending) result of asynchronous request.</p>

        <h3>States of Promises</h3>
        <h5>1. Pending</h5>
        <p> The underlying operation has not yet completed or neither rejected</p>

        <h5>2. Fulfilled</h5>
        <p> The operation has finished and promise is fulfilled with a response. (.then()) is used handle fulfilled response. </p>

        <h5>3. Rejected </h5>
        <p> The error occurred during the operation is rejected with a reason. (.catch()) is used to catch the error. </p>

        <h5>4. Settled </h5>
        <p> A promise a said to settled, (either resolved or rejected). Once the promise is settled, it becomes immutable. </p>
