            1.	Arithmetic Operators => Addition +, Subtraction -, Multiplication *, Division /, Modulus %, Increment ++, Decrement --

            2.	Comparison (Relational) Operators => Is equal to ==, Identical (equal and of same data type) ===, Not equal to !=, Not Identical !==, Greater than >, 
            Greater equal to >=, Less than <, Less than or equal to <=

            3.	Bitwise Operators => Bitwise AND &, Bitwise OR |, Bitwise XOR ^, Bitwise NOT ~, Bitwise Left Shift <<, 
            Bitwise Right Shift >>, Bitwise Right Shift with Zero >>>

            4.	Logical Operators => Logical AND &&, Logical OR ||, Logical Not ! 

            5.	Assignment Operators => Assign =, Add and Assign +=, Subtract and assign -=, Multiply and assign *=, Divide and assign /=, Modulus and assign %=

            6.	Special or Ternary Operators => condition ? "true":"false";
